                Independent and agile, Baymart quickly established itself as a main contractor to watch in London. Our growth in work was matched by an expansion of the team, initially through the onboarding of long-standing colleagues and friends known for their proven abilities, followed by the recruitment of new industry talent.
            </p>
            <p>
                From inception, Baymart delivered an exceptional portfolio of schemes in the capital. These included landmark structures and developments such as Axtell House, a state-of-the-art mixed-use site in London’s Soho, and the UK debut for international hotel brand Ruby Lucy in Waterloo. We demonstrated the calibre of our capabilities in new-build and refurbishment projects through consistent delivery of outstanding quality and defined our specialisation in the commercial, residential, leisure and hotel sectors.
            </p>
            <p>With a controlled growth strategy in place, Baymart continued to evolve significantly and profitably. Momentum was maintained throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, with the company keeping sites operational and no impact on staff, without any reliance on government support. Similarly, Baymart has remained in a strong position in the face of Brexit’s challenges to the industry due to strong internal frameworks and consistent supplier relationships. </p>
            <p>
                Baymart now employs 100 people across its Group structure, comprising distinct divisions: Baymart London, Baymart South West. The Group’s values and objectives steer its approach to client and project work as Baymart continues to implement positive change and a legacy.
